# Using the Playground

This playground supports two modes of operation: patch processing and patch generation.  What to put where and what to click depends on what you want to do.

Keep reading for how to use each.

## Patch Processing

To process a JSON Patch, enter your patch into the left editor and your JSON data into the right editor.

Click _Apply_.

The results, or any errors, will appear in the bottom editor.

## Patch Generation

To generate a patch between two JSON data, enter the original (source) data into the left editor and the target data into the right editor.

Click _Generate_.

The resulting patch, if possible, will appear in the bottom editor.
